= MachineHealthChecks on Bare Metal

Machine deletion on bare metal cluster triggers reprovisioning of a bare metal host.
Usually bare metal reprovisioning is a lengthy process, in which the cluster 
is lacking compute power, and some applications are down.
To change the default remediation process from machine deletion to host power-cycle,
the MachineHealthCheck resource should be annotated with 
`machine.openshift.io/remediation-strategy: external-baremetal`

Once the annotation is set, unhealthy machines will be power-cycled by using 
BMC credentials.
